# Game of Amazons with scope ai and Monte Carlo tree search

Comparing the game of Amazons using a heuristic based ai and Monte Carlo tree search. Includes UI to play against the agents and to pair them against each other.

Alpha-beta pruning is also included but it is no good for Amazons as the game tree is too deep. It can however be used near the end of the game or with a good heuristic after certain depth. In fact turning on one of the other algorithms after certain depth of min max would be good balance of both.
